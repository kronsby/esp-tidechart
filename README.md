A tide chart for the Lilygo T-Display S3

I made this with the help of Gemini in a sitting while hanging out with my family at the beach. It ended up being really useful, and I am
thinking about making it into a real device I can bring every year. This year, it was powered off of my huge (45000mAh) battery pack we
use when traveling and it sat on a shelf on the kitchen. I hadn't updated it to run the 15 minute delay code, and so it was updating
every 10 seconds until it died 5 days after I had first started. With 15 minutes, it should be way better, and could be updated to be
ultra energy efficient. I think it could be a really cool single use device with a little bit of polish!
